# The Hero of Canton Game

An experiment with Phoenix LiveView.

## Assignment

Please read the project requirements located in the [assignment.pdf](assignment.pdf) file in the root of this project.

## Getting Started

This is just a vanilla Elixir/Phoenix project with no other external Elixir dependencies and only TailwindCSS on the front-end side. To try it out on your local machine:

1. Install **Elixir**, **Erlang**, and **Node.js**. I recommend installing all three via the [asdf Version Manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).
2. Run `mix local.hex`.
3. Install Phoenix by following the instructions in the [Phoenix Installation Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content)
4. Head over to [Pragmatic Studio](https://pragmaticstudio.com) and pick up some Elixir courses from **Mike** and **Nicole**, because they're amazing. The courses are pretty good too.
5. Grab the code from **Github** by typing `git clone https://github.com/cdeyoung/hero_of_canton_game.git` in your favorite directory.
6. Once `git` has done it's magic, `cd` into `your_project_directory/apps/web/assets` and type `npm install`.
7. Then, `cd` back to `your_project_directory` and type `mix deps.get` to get all the dependencies, even though there aren't any, because it is nice to have good habits.
8. Then, if my brain hasn't betrayed me again, you can run `iex -S mix phx.server` and browse to [The Hero of Canton Game](http://localhost:4000).
